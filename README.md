__notes:__

* what it does:
  * file system manager
* what I like:
  * the APK is tiny (328 KB)
  * supports Android 1.6+
    * personally tested on Android 4.4 KitKat
      * works perfectly
  * packs __a lot__ of functionality and features
    * could easily be stripped down and used as the basis for a customized file system browser Activity
* what I dislike:
  * for what it is:
    * absolutely nothing
  * for what it is not:
    * the UI could use an update to _Material Design_

__to do:__

* add Gradle build scripts
